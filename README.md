# Soldiers of Kolumbo

Soldiers of Kolumbo is a silly little sci-fi role-playing game. Hire mercenaries, take on missions, gather loot and get rich!

Playable builds for Windows/Linux/Max are available on [itch.io](https://luolamies.itch.io/sok).

I created the game as a (late) birthday gift for my brother in 2023, but it doesn't really contain any in-jokes you'd need to know to enjoy it.

The game is written using [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk), which is a fantastic little engine/toolkit. DragonRuby was my first contact with Ruby, so I don't guarantee high code quality :) Still, I figured releasing the source code may be useful for some!

The game loosely adapts rules from the [Traveller](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/collections/traveller-rpgs) RPG, which are available [under a license](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/System_Reference_Document). I figured it'd be good to mention, even though I'm not sure if strictly required.
